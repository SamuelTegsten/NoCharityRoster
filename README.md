<h1 align="center">Welcome to the No Charity Roster Project!</h1>
<p align="center">Manage your roster with ease and style. </p>
<p align="center">My tip whould be to order the melee and ranged one after another so when rolling for a bench, you bench one melee and one ranged at a time.</p>

<h2 align="center">🚀 Getting Started</h2>
<p align="center">Get started with the No Charity Roster by opening the HTML file in your web browser. This application offers an array of features to simplify your roster management:</p>

<ul>
    <li align="center"><strong>📋 Display Roster:</strong> Easily view your roster in a tabular format, including columns for Name, Class, Spec, Bench Amount, Decrement, and Delete.</li>
    <li align="center"><strong>🎲 Roll Bench:</strong> Effortlessly select eligible individuals for the bench based on specific criteria by clicking the "Roll Bench" button.</li>
    <li align="center"><strong>🔄 Reset Bench Counts:</strong> Reset bench counts for all individuals to zero with a simple click on the "Reset Bench Counts" button.</li>
    <li align="center"><strong>➕ Add New Entries:</strong> Expand your roster by adding new entries through the form at the bottom of the page. Provide Name, Class, Spec, and Bench data, and hit "Submit" to add them.</li>
    <li align="center"><strong>🔽 Decrement:</strong> Decrease bench counts for individual roster members by clicking the "Decrement" button.</li>
    <li align="center"><strong>🗑️ Delete:</strong> Remove individuals from the roster with ease using the "Delete" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">How It Works</h2>
<p align="center">The No Charity Roster leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a user-friendly interface. Your roster data is stored in your browser's local storage, ensuring you can always access your roster, even if you close the browser.</p>

<h2 align="center">Customization</h2>
<p align="center">Customize the application to match your preferences and website design by modifying the CSS styles in the provided Style.css file.</p>
